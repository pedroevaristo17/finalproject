        <h1>My Education</h1>
        <p>My first school was Espaço de Educar in Maceió, Brazil. After that, I went to high school at another school in my city, where I graduated and decided to pursue Law. I studied Law for a year and a half before realizing it wasn’t the right field for me. I genuinely wanted to go into technology/web development. I took a basic computer science course at SENAI in Brazil, and I discovered I really enjoyed it. Soon after, I started studying online at Alura, where I earned several certificates. Then, I began studying Information Systems at CESMAC in Brazil. I completed six months of that program and started researching education opportunities in Canada. And here I am now! Currently, I’m studying Web Development at Tamwood Careers from 2025 to 2026. This is my first website, and I hope you enjoy it!

            <h1>My experience</h1>
            <p>When I was younger, I grew up in a family environment that strongly valued empathy and helping others. In 2014, my father took me to do volunteer work at a place called Casa do Caminho in Brazil, which was an incredible experience. Then, in 2017, I started going there regularly and continued for two years.

            We prepared food, cleaned dishes and utensils, and every Friday, we would go out to distribute meals to those in need at various locations around the city. This experience taught me the importance of community, kindness, and making a difference in people's lives, no matter how small the gesture.</p>
